# IFS-Maxima

Since 2006 is available in Maxima the package fractals, and IFS is the approach used in that package.

Copies of the package fractals.mac and rtest_fractals.mac are shared here as reference for further study.
Also is shared a copy of the work of Krzysztof Le≈õniak and Nina Snigireva that can be found here (http://repozytorium.umk.pl/handle/item/6317); the file is named Sym5disjunctiveChaosGame_2020-06-02.wxm .

Some modifications will be made to Sym5disjunctiveChaosGame_2020-06-02.wxm for better understanding.
I hope this could be clarifying about further implementations of the IFS approach to fractals in Maxima. 

Some code and images about Kronecker based fractals are shared.

The file MandelbrotKreuter.wxm is added for reference about how generate fractals.
